# bloveland-OOP_FinalProject
Final project for OOP with Ben, Liam, and Dillon

Our project will be a web app hosted on Github Pages that allows a user to play Connect 4 against ChatGPT.
We will use the ChatGPT API to send the current board state to the LLM, and interpret its response as a game action.
For more project details check the Write-Abstract folder and the 4+1_Views folder.
