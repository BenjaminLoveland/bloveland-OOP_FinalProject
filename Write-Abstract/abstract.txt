Connect 4 V.S. ChatGPT

Our project will be a web app that incorporates ChatGPT in order to create a Connect 4 game that can be played against ChatGPT.
We will make a web app that runs Connect 4, and then queries ChatGPT using its API in order to get its moves. We will have to
send game data to ChatGPT in order for it to be well informed about the game state, and then we will have to recieve its move
and translate that into usable data for our web app. We will likely use Github Pages to host our web app, and we will use conventional
OOP practices and techniques discussed in class throughout development.
